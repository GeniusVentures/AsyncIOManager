## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: CMake MNN purge (MNN-01) deliberately grouped with the generic example (Phase 4), not with the Phase 1 code purge — the library never links MNN (`MNNCommon.hpp` flows only through `MNNLoader.hpp`, which Phase 1 deletes), so decoupling keeps each phase small and green.
- [Roadmap]: Test renames (TEST-01/02) live in Phase 1 alongside the class renames — the tests reference `MNNLoader`/`MNNSaver` symbols and the `parse` flag, so deferring them would break the suite at the Phase 1 boundary.
- [Roadmap]: `test/base_mnn_test.hpp` is dead code (no test includes it) and `.mnn` assets are only consumed by the example — fixture replacement (MNN-03) naturally groups with Phase 4's example rewrite.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: POSIX split (`LocalFileCommon.posix.*`) is verified structurally only — no Linux CI in this environment (per PROJECT.md Out of Scope).
